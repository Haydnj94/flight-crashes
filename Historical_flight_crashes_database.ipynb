Shortly after takeoff, while climbing to a height of about 700-800 feet, all four engines stopped. The pilot elected to return for an emergency landing when the aircraft stalled and crashed in a field located in front of 21 Garrick Avenue in Golders Green, bursting into flames. Colonel Ogilvie, who was seating in the tail gunner position at the back of the plane, survived, while all five other occupants were killed.

Frank Stuart Patterson, son and nephew of the co-founders of National Cash Register, is killed in the crash of his DH.4M, AS-32098, at Wilbur Wright Field during a flight test of a new mechanism for synchronizing machine gun and propeller, when a tie rod breaks during a dive from 15,000 feet (4,600 m), causing the wings to separate from the aircraft. Wishing to recognize the contributions of the Patterson family (owners of NCR) the area of Wright Field east of Huffman Dam (including Wilbur Wright Field, Fairfield Air Depot, and the Huffman Prairie) is renamed Patterson Field on 6 July 1931, in honor of Lt.
